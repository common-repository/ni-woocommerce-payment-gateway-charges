<h4>Ni WooCommerce Payment Gateway Charges Overview</h4>
<p>
Easily incorporate additional charges for any payment gateway with the Ni WooCommerce Payment Gateway Charges plugin. Enhance your WooCommerce checkout payment gateways by adding extra fees based on your preferences. This extension supports the addition of extra fees options to WooCommerce payment gateways such as "BACS," "CHEQUE," and "COD," as well as any custom payment gateways integrated into your system.
</p>
<p>
The extra charge can be calculated as either a "Fixed Amount" or a "Percentage," depending on your backend settings.
</p>
<p>
Within the plugin settings, you can enable the "Enable Extra Charges" option to include these additional charges in the overall calculation.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the plugin provides an "Extra Charges Option" setting with two choices: "Include Tax" and "Exclude Tax." If "Include Tax" is selected, the Extra Charge will be added to the cart subtotal, and taxes will be applied accordingly.
